CSCI112 Semester Project

Television Broadcast Station Emulator

The program should emulate a television broadcast station. In this scope, the functionality that matters is the ability to use a specifically organized file directory to produce "channels" wherein video files are scheduled categorically. The end user can expect to run the program and select a channel based on a description, after which a media player is evoked and a video file (and playlist of upcoming video files) is queued based on time of day relative to the program's "schedule".
